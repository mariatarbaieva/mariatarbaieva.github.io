The goal was to simplify user journey in existing IOS app and create Android app from scratch with new imrovements based on user tests. The new and interesting challenge for me was product ownership, collaboration with stakeholders and team, gathering requirements. I understood how much work stays behind designers and developers eyes, how difficult to combine new feature requests and developers performance. How important to make trade offs from both sides. </text>

The goal is to display data that meets business requirements, to combine stakeholders requests and developers perfomance, to display data in easy to understand and analyse way and make data analysys more prodactive. Solved problems: information was visualised which the wrong focus: pie chart where used to compare complex amount of data and was cluttered while number of categories should be 3 or less; interesting data for business analyses wasnt displayed and hided deeply in the system; the main data analyses where based on teams, while after collaborattion with stakeholders and user tests was defined that main data should be based on information about test kits.

                                <h5 style="font-weight: 700;">- <a target="_blank" href="http://efarmer.mobi/">eFarmer</a></h5><text>This is an agricultural startup that offers GPS guidance . This app helps farmers to plan field boundaries and paths for tractors and harvesters, documents farmers work, helps to optimize work by providing reports.<br>
                                eFarmer team has agile approach and specifically we used scrum. For me that was a great experience working with people in one team like that. That really helped me to see how everything fits together. I think I have learned a lot about teamwork.<br>
                                As we didn’t have UX designer there, we worked closely with product manager. He provided all information about users and according to this information we created mockups. I helped him with presentation for investors, created graphics for iOS, Android and responsive graphics for desktop, created banners and all set of printed products for exhibitions. Also I collaborated closely with developers during implementation process. From that job I’ve learned technical aspects. For example preparing graphics for development due to guidelines.<br>
                                This startup is still going strong. They are taking part in different startup exhibitions and this product is used by farmers from across the Europe.
